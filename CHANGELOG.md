## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Sequential specs now run as a subtest named by their full `Describe`/`When`/`It` breadcrumb
  instead of the leaf `It` name alone, in both sequential execution models (`Describe`/`Spec` and
  `Builder`/`Runner`). Two specs sharing an `It` name under different scopes are no longer told
  apart by `testing`'s incidental `#01` suffix, and `go test -run 'TestX/Suite/when_b/does_a_thing'`
  selects one behaviour by its declared context. The breadcrumb is joined with `/` and never
  escaped, so the guarantee is stated over the name `testing` actually uses: two specs are
  independently identifiable whenever their *normalized* breadcrumbs differ. Breadcrumbs that
  normalize to the same string — `When("a/b")` against `Describe("a")`/`When("b")`, or `When("when a")`
  against `When("when_a")` — stay ambiguous and keep `testing`'s `#01` numbering, the same ambiguity
  `testing.T.Run` has on its own; this is accepted so that `-run` patterns stay typeable from the
  declared names. The mapping is an internal detail and is not exported. Reporter `Name` and `Path`
  values are unchanged — they remain the framework's own unsanitized values. `DescribeFlat`,
  `DescribeFast`, and `*testing.B` runs create no subtests and are unaffected.
