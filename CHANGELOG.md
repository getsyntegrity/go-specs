## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Sequential specs now run as a subtest named by their full `Describe`/`When`/`It` breadcrumb
  instead of the leaf `It` name alone, in both sequential execution models (`Describe`/`Spec` and
  `Builder`/`Runner`). Two specs sharing an `It` name under different scopes are no longer told
  apart by `testing`'s incidental `#01` suffix, and `go test -run 'TestX/Suite/when_b/does_a_thing'`
  selects one behaviour by its declared context. The breadcrumb is joined with `/` and never
  escaped, so the guarantee is stated over the name `testing` actually uses: two specs are
  independently identifiable whenever their *normalized* breadcrumbs differ. Breadcrumbs that
  normalize to the same string — `When("a/b")` against `Describe("a")`/`When("b")`, or `When("when a")`
  against `When("when_a")` — stay ambiguous and keep `testing`'s `#01` numbering. That is a
  consequence of go-specs flattening the declared tree into a single `t.Run` per spec, not a
  limitation `testing` imposes: the whole breadcrumb has to fit in one subtest name. The discarded
  alternative is nesting a real `t.Run` per scope, which would cost the allocation-free runner; it is
  not escaping, which would break `-run` patterns typed from the declared names. The mapping is an
  internal detail and is not exported.

  Reporter `Name` and `Path` values are unchanged: `specEventPath` is byte-identical before and after
  this change. `Name` stays the declared leaf name verbatim. `Path`, however, is not simply "the
  breadcrumb", and was not before either — the `Describe`/`Spec` model rebuilds it by splitting the
  joined breadcrumb on `/`, so `It("slash/inside")` reports four segments whose last one is not the
  `Name`, and the `Builder`/`Runner` model reports no `Path` at all. Both pre-date this change and
  are tracked in [#112](https://github.com/getsyntegrity/go-specs/issues/112) and
  [#113](https://github.com/getsyntegrity/go-specs/issues/113).

  This applies to every run whose backend is a real `*testing.T`, including `DescribeFlat` and
  `DescribeFast`: despite their names, both create one subtest per spec exactly like `Describe`, so
  both are renamed by this change too. Only a `*testing.B` backend runs without subtests and is
  genuinely unaffected.

  **Migration.** A `-run` pattern that named a spec by its `It` name alone no longer matches; it now
  needs the full breadcrumb. `go test -run 'TestCart/has_no_items'` becomes
  `go test -run 'TestCart/Cart/empty/has_no_items'`. This affects CI scripts that pin specific
  specs, and saved per-test re-run buttons in IDEs, which will silently select nothing until the
  stored pattern is regenerated.

  Two pre-existing behaviours become easier to meet now that `-run` is a documented way to select
  specs. Under a narrow `-run` pattern the `Builder`/`Runner` model still executes the group
  `BeforeEach`/`AfterEach` hooks of specs the pattern discarded, because those hooks run outside the
  subtest; the `Describe`/`Spec` model does not. And in either model a spec whose subtest the filter
  discarded is still reported to an attached reporter as started and finished without failing, so it
  appears as passed although its body never ran. Both are tracked separately.

### Fixed

- Failing built-in assertions now report the user's own assertion file and line instead of a
  go-specs internal frame such as `testing_backend.go` or `context.go`. Terminal and IDE output
  jump straight to the behaviour that broke. Covers `EqualTo`, `ExpectT(...).ToEqual`/`.To`,
  `Context.Expect(...).ToEqual`/`.To`, and `ctx.Snapshot`, across `Describe`, `DescribeFlat`,
  `DescribeFast`, and the Builder/Runner path. The passing fast path is unchanged: caller discovery
  still happens only on failure, and assertions still allocate nothing when they pass.
